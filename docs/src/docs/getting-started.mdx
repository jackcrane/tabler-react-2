Welcome to Tabler React 2! This guide will help you get started with the library and its components.

## Installation

To install Tabler React 2, you can use npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install tabler-react-2 @tabler/icons-react
```

```bash
yarn add tabler-react-2 @tabler/icons-react
```

## Usage

To use Tabler React 2, you need to wrap your application with the `TablerProvider` component. This component provides the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for Tabler React 2.

```jsx
import { TablerProvider } from "tabler-react-2";

function App() {
  return (
    <TablerProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </TablerProvider>
  );
}
```

<p>

**Note:** If you are using the `react-router-dom` library, you will need to set the `fallbackAnchor` prop to `false` in the `TablerProvider` component. This way, links will use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` instead of the default anchor tag.

```jsx
<TablerProvider fallbackAnchor={false}>...</TablerProvider>
```

</p>
