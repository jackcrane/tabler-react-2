# Introduction

Tabler React 2 is a React implementation of [Tabler](https://tabler.io) UI components, but is not an official project of Tabler. It is still a work in progress, but breaking changes are not to be expected.

## Installation

To install Tabler React 2, you can use npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install tabler-react-2 @tabler/icons-react
```

```bash
yarn add tabler-react-2 @tabler/icons-react
```

## Usage

To use Tabler React 2, you need to wrap your application with the `TablerProvider` component. This component provides the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for Tabler React 2.

```jsx
import { TablerProvider } from "tabler-react-2";

function App() {
  return (
    <TablerProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </TablerProvider>
  );
}
```
